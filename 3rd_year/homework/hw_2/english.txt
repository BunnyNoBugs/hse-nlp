Yesterday was a really bad day. Firstly, I overheard a strange talk. One person was speaking to the other: “That is unbearable! There was a fellow who started eating at the warehouse! Not only I had to fix a leak after them, but I also had to clean the stove!”. I heard this conversation while I was on my way home. It seemed like both of them work at the factory (one of them had a saw in his hands). Later, when I was going past the park, I saw that only stumps were left of it and they were burning the grass around them. Apparently, they have scared off a swarm of bees and it started chasing me. I was so scared as if someone was threatening me with a gun. All in all, the day was so unusual that I have decided to write a few rhymes about it.
